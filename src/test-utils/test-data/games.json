For languages different from the languages that you know, everything may seem random and unexpected. Even languages that share similarities, such as Spanish and Portuguese, there are several “false friends”, that is words that seem to be a synonym of a word in other language, but whose meaning is not the same.

The conjugation of regular verbs is determined by some rules. On the other hand, irregular verbs are a bit random, but there are still some patterns that can be identified. The common point between all tenses and kind of verbs is that mastering them requires practice, so let’s start!"
